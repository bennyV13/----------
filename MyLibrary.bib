	abstract = {Mixing is the operation by which a system evolves under stirring from one state of simplicity—the initial segregation of the constituents—to another state of simplicity—their complete uniformity. Between these extremes, patterns emerge, possibly interact, and die sooner or later. This review summarizes recent developments on the problem of mixing in its lamellar representation. This point of view visualizes a mixture as a set of stretched lamellae, or sheets, possibly interacting with each other. It relies on a near-exact formulation of the Fourier equation on a moving substrate and allows one to bridge the spatial structure and evolution of the concentration ﬁeld with its statistical content in a direct way. Within this frame, one can precisely describe both the dynamics of the concentration levels in a mixture as a function of the intensity of the stirring motions at the scale of a single lamella and the interaction rule between adjacent lamellae, thus offering a detailed representation of the mixture content, its structure, and their evolution in time.},

	abstract = {This review is motivated by the fast progress in our understanding of the physics of particle-laden turbulence in the last decade, partly due to the tremendous advances of measurement and simulation capabilities. The focus is on spherical particles in homogeneous and canonical wall-bounded flows. The analysis of recent data indicates that conclusions drawn in zero gravity should not be extrapolated outside of this condition, and that the particle response time alone cannot completely define the dynamics of finite-size particles. Several breakthroughs have been reported, mostly separately, on the dynamics and turbulence modifications of small inertial particles in dilute conditions and of large weakly buoyant spheres. Measurements at higher concentrations, simulations fully resolving smaller particles, and theoretical tools accounting for both phases are needed to bridge this gap and allow for the exploration of the fluid dynamics of suspensions, from laminar rheology and granular media to particulate turbulence.},

Collisions of dust grains are also conjectured to be important for planet formation in the gas surrounding young stars and to play a role in the dynamics of sand storms. In these processes, collisions are favored by fast turbulent motions. Here we review recent advances in the understanding of collisional aggregation due to turbulence. We discuss the role of fractal clustering of particles and caustic singularities of their velocities. We also discuss limitations of the Smoluchowski equation for modeling such processes. These advances lead to a semiquantitative understanding on the inﬂuence of turbulence on collision rates and point to deﬁciencies in the current understanding of rainfall and planet formation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the deposition and resuspension of rigid elongated particles transported by turbulence in a channel bounded by two-dimensional roughness. To analyze these processes, we use an Euler–Lagrange approach based on Direct Numerical Simulation of the carrier phase and Lagrangian Particle Tracking of the dispersed phase. Four different channel configurations are considered: One is the classical channel flow bounded by smooth flat walls, whereas the other three correspond to a channel with walls of increasing roughness. The roughness shape is obtained by superimposition of sinusoidal functions with different amplitude 𝑘 and is characterized by the mean absolute value of the amplitude, ̄𝑘 = 0.012, 0.024 and 0.050 (̄𝑘 = 0 for a smooth wall). The friction Reynolds number is 𝑅𝑒𝜏 = 150 for all cases. Particles are modeled as prolate ellipsoids and classified according to their aspect ratio 𝜆. Three different particles sets are considered: 𝜆 = 1, corresponding to the reference case of spheres, 𝜆 = 3, corresponding to slightly elongated particles, and 𝜆 = 10, corresponding to long fiber-like particles. The particle response time is 𝑆𝑡+ = 5 for all sets. In turbulent flow bounded by smooth walls, particles are known to accumulate preferentially in the near-wall region, leaving the central region of the channel scarcely populated. Wall roughness produces a completely different scenario: Particles exhibit a more homogeneous distribution along the wall-normal direction. We show that the aspect ratio does not affect the preferential distribution and the velocity statistics of the particles. The effect of elongation, however, becomes important for their preferential orientation, which is much weaker than in the smooth-walls case, in the near-wall region, while recovering the smooth-walls case in the outer region of the channel. This finding supports the validity of Townsend’s similarity hypothesis, namely that the bulk flow dynamics are unaffected by the roughening of the bounding walls.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of ﬂexible ﬁbers in turbulent channel ﬂow. Fibers are longer than the Kolmogorov length scale of the carrier ﬂow, and their velocity relative to the surrounding ﬂuid is non-negligible. Our aim is to examine the effect of local shear and turbulence anisotropy on the translational and rotational behavior of the ﬁbers, considering different elongation (parameterized by the aspect ratio, λ) and inertia (parameterized by the Stokes number, St). To these aims, we use a Eulerian–Lagrangian approach based on direct numerical simulation of turbulence in the dilute regime. Fibers are modeled as chains of sub-Kolmogorov rods (referred to as elements hereinafter) connected through ball-and-socket joints that enable bending and twisting under the action of the local ﬂuid velocity gradients. Velocity, orientation, and concentration statistics, extracted from simulations at shear Reynolds number Reτ = 150 (based on the channel half height), are presented to give insights into the complex ﬁber–turbulence interactions that arise when non-sphericity and deformability add to inertial bias. These statistical observables are examined at varying aspect ratios (namely λr = lr /a = 2 and 5, with lr the semi-length of each rod-like element r composing the ﬁber and a its cross-sectional radius) and varying ﬁber inertia (considering values of the element Stokes number, Str = 1, 5, 30). To highlight the effect of ﬂexibility, statistics are compared with those obtained for ﬁbers of equal mass that translate and rotate as rigid bodies relative to the surrounding ﬂuid. Flexible ﬁbers exhibit a stronger tendency to accumulate in the very-near-wall region, where they appear to be trapped by the same inertia-driven mechanisms that govern the preferential concentration of spherical particles and rigid ﬁbers in bounded ﬂows. In such region, the bending of ﬂexible ﬁbers increases as inertia decreases, and ﬁber deformation appears to be controlled by mean shear and turbulent Reynolds stresses. Preferential segregation into low-speed streaks and preferential orientation in the mean ﬂow direction is also observed.},

	abstract = {Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurement and large eddy simulation (LES) were used to study confined isothermal turbulent swirling flows in a model dump combustor. The aim was to gain deeper understanding of the flow and turbulence structures in dump combustors and to examine the capability of LES for prediction of turbulent swirling flows. A refractive index matching technique is used in the LDV measurement to improve the near-wall data. A high-order finite difference scheme on Cartesian grids with a scale-similarity subfilter scale model is used in the LES. Turbulent inflow boundary conditions with different energy spectra, different outflow boundary conditions, and grid resolutions are tested in the LES. Three test cases with different swirl numbers and Reynolds numbers are studied in the measurements and the simulations. The Reynolds numbers range from 10 000 to 20 000, and the swirl number is varied from 0 to 0.43. With appropriate inflow, outflow boundary conditions, and fine grid resolution, the LES results are in fairly good agreement with the LDV data. The experimental and numerical results show that turbulence in the dump combustor is highly anisotropic behind the sudden expansion and in the internal recirculation zone near the axis of the combustor. Turbulence decays rapidly along the streamwise direction downstream, and the structure of turbulence depends highly on the level of inlet swirl. At low swirl numbers, turbulence is primarily generated in the shear layer behind the sudden expansion; at high swirl numbers the near axis flow becomes very unstable and vortex breakdown occurs. The shear layer near the axis of the combustor caused by vortex breakdown generates most of the turbulent kinetic energy. Large-scale motions (coherent structures) are found in the near axis vortex breakdown region. A helical flow in the guiding pipe breaks down near the sudden expansion to form a large bubble-like recirculation zone whose center moves slowly around the axis. Downstream of the bubble the core of the rotational large scale azimuthal flow motion is off the combustor axis and rotates around the axis at a frequency about 18–25 Hz (Strouhal number about 0.17–0.4). As the swirl number increases the coherent structure becomes more evident, and the internal recirculation zone moves upstream. LES successfully simulated the vortex breakdown, the internal recirculation zones and the anisotropic turbulence structures for all the swirl numbers considered.},

	abstract = {Anisotropic particles are common in many industrial and natural turbulent ﬂows. When these particles are small and neutrally buoyant, they follow Lagrangian trajectories while exhibiting rich orientational dynamics from the coupling of their rotation to the velocity gradients of the turbulence ﬁeld. This system has proven to be a fascinating application of the fundamental properties of velocity gradients in turbulence. When particles are not neutrally buoyant, they experience preferential concentration and very different preferential alignment than neutrally buoyant tracer particles. A vast proportion of the parameter range of anisotropic particles in turbulence is still unexplored, with most existing research focusing on the simple foundational cases of axisymmetric ellipsoids at low concentrations in homogeneous isotropic turbulence and in turbulent channel ﬂow. Numerical simulations and experiments have recently developed a fairly comprehensive picture of alignment and rotation in these cases, and they provide an essential foundation for addressing more complex problems of practical importance. Macroscopic effects of nonspherical particle dynamics include preferential concentration in coherent structures and drag reduction by ﬁber suspensions. We review the models used to describe nonspherical particle motion, along with numerical and experimental methods for measuring particle dynamics.},

	abstract = {The orientation moments and stresses for a suspension of rigid fibers are calculated along Lagrangian pathlines in a drag-reduced turbulent channel flow. The turbulent flow fields are calculated using the methods developed by Paschkewitz et al. [“Numerical simulation of turbulent drag reduction using rigid fibers,” J. Fluid Mech. 518, 281 (2004)]. These authors investigated turbulent drag reduction using rigid fibers with the Eulerian frame of reference direct numerical simulations, and demonstrated a correlation of drag reduction with fluctuations or “bursts” of fiber stress in intervortex extensional flow regions. These bursts are defined as events where certain components of the fiber stress exceed a specified level. Using probability density functions (PDFs) of the fiber stress contribution to the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy weighted by the probability of occurrence of a particular stress level, we demonstrate that less than 0.001\% of the dissipation is created by stress fluctuations of magnitude ∣τ13∣\&gt;5 and ∣τ22∣\&gt;7. We therefore define a “small” burst or fluctuation as one of this magnitude or less and a “large” burst to be one having a magnitude greater than these thresholds. Using conditional statistics in the Lagrangian frame, the detailed dynamics responsible for the generation of these stress bursts are quantitatively characterized. As a precursor to the burst, the fibers move into extensional flow regions and align with the wall-normal or spanwise directional axis in a process that takes approximately two local strain units, where the strain rate is defined along the direction of the fiber orientation. After the stress increases past a chosen large value and the stress burst begins, the fibers continue to align and generate increasing stress until the burst is roughly half complete; at this time, the extensional character of the surrounding flow is reduced to a level such that the fibers begin to realign in the flow direction and the fiber stresses decrease. These stress bursts also have a total duration of approximately two local strain units. By considering the flow kinematics in regions near the particle, as well as the time autocorrelation of fiber stress and the second flow invariant Q, we demonstrate that the bursts end because the surrounding vortices are strongly weakened or destroyed by the gradients in fiber stresses. Both frequently observed small stress fluctuations and rare large stress fluctuations exhibit this behavior, with the primary difference being the strength of the nearby vortices and the resulting extensional flow region that the fiber resides in during the burst. However, the more commonly observed small stress fluctuations appear to make the largest contribution to fiber dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and thus are responsible for the majority of the drag reduction effect. The largest contribution to fiber dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy is made by small fluctuations in the spanwise shear stress component τ13, which result from fibers primarily confined to the x-z plane weakly rotating towards the z axis.},

            Despite being relevant in many natural and industrial processes, suspensions of nonspherical particles have been largely underinvestigated compared with the extensive analyses made on the gravity‐driven motions of spherical particles. One of the main reasons for this disparity is the difficulty of accurately correcting the short‐range hydrodynamic forces and torques acting on complex particles. These effects, also known as lubrication, are essential to the suspension of the particles and are usually poorly captured by direct numerical simulation of particle‐laden flows. In this article, we propose a partitioned volume penalization‐discrete element method solver, which estimates the unresolved hydrodynamic forces and torques. Corrections are made locally on the surface of the interacting particles without any assumption on the particle global geometry. Numerical validations have been made using ellipsoidal particles immersed in an incompressible Navier‐Stokes flow.},

              This study provides a detailed account of stochastic approaches that may be utilized in Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations to account for neighbour-induced drag force fluctuations. The frameworks examined here correspond to Langevin equations for the particle position (PL), particle velocity (VL) and fluctuating drag force (FL). Rigorous derivations of the particle velocity variance (granular temperature) and dispersion resulting from each method are presented. The solutions derived herein provide a basis for comparison with particle-resolved direct numerical simulation. The FL method allows for the most complex behaviour, enabling control of both the granular temperature and dispersion. A Stokes number

two operators to the Navier-Stokes equations: a smooth filter and a discretization 
operator. The introduction
              ab initio
              of the discretization influences the structure of 
the unknown stress in the LES equations, which now contain a subgrid-scale stress 
tensor mainly due to discretization, and a filtered-scale stress tensor mainly due to 
filtering. Theoretical arguments are proposed supporting eddy viscosity models for 
the subgrid-scale stress tensor. However, no exact result can be derived for this term 
because the discretization is responsible for a loss of information and because its 
exact nature is usually unknown. The situation is different for the filtered-scale stress 
tensor for which an exact expansion in terms of the large-scale velocity and its 
derivatives is derived for a wide class of filters including the Gaussian, the tophat and 
all discrete filters. As a consequence of this generalized result, the filtered-scale stress 
tensor is shown to be invariant under the change of sign of the large-scale velocity. 
This implies that the filtered-scale stress tensor should lead to reversible dynamics 
in the limit of zero molecular viscosity when the discretization effects are neglected. 
Numerical results that illustrate this effect are presented together with a discussion 
on other approaches leading to reversible dynamics like the scale similarity based 
models and, surprisingly, the dynamic procedure.},

 value is found to 
be in good agreement with a simple criterion derived in the same spirit
 as the first 
stage of Escudier \& Keller's (1983) theory. Four distinct forms
 of vortex breakdown 
are identified: the well documented bubble state, a new cone configuration
 in which 
the vortex takes the form of an open conical sheet, and two associated
 asymmetric 
bubble and asymmetric cone states, which are only observed at large Reynolds
 
numbers. The two latter configurations differ from the former by the precession
 of 
the stagnation point around the jet axis in a co-rotating direction with
 respect to the 
upstream vortex flow. The two flow configurations, bubble or cone, are

gradually sets in, a stagnation point appearing in the downstream turbulent
 region 
of the flow and slowly moving upstream until it reaches an equilibrium
 location. 
In an intermediate range of Reynolds numbers, the breakdown threshold displays
 
hysteresis lying in the ability of the breakdown state to remain 
stable for

swirling jet is highly asymmetric and takes the shape of a steady helix.

In an earlier study, Vogel (1968) defined the stability limit in the (H/R, 12RVo) plane within which a vortex breakdown bubble occurred on the axis of symmetry. The results of Vogel's investigation are confirmed and extended by the present work. In particular, it is found that as H/R is increased two further stability limits can be determined within which two and ultimately three breakdown bubbles occur in succession. It is also found that there is a Reynolds number boundary above which the flow is oscillatory and at even higher Reynolds number the flow becomes turbulent.

	abstract = {This experimental and numerical work explains why a vortex breakdown bubble ﬁrst emerges and then disappears as the ﬂuid rotation speeds up. To this end, we explore a ﬂow in a sealed cylindrical container with one end disk rotating and all other walls stationary. The rotation drives the meridional circulation: the ﬂuid ﬁlling the container moves away from the rotating disk along the sidewall, converges to the axis near the stationary disk, and goes back to the rotating disk near the axis. As the rotation speed Re increases, a cell of counter circulation—a vortex breakdown bubble (VBB)—emerges, expands, contracts, and disappears. On the (h, Re) map, the boundary of the VBB region consists of two branches, which meet and terminate at a fold point as h decreases (h = H/R, where H is the height and R is the radius of the cylinder). This study is the ﬁrst to focus on the VB disappearance and explains the geometry of VBB region: why the VBB ﬁrst emerges and then disappears as Re increases at a ﬁxed h. In a few words, the mechanism is as follows. The convergence of the swirling ﬂow to the axis reduces the pressure above the center of the stationary disk. Suction because of the reduced pressure creates a VBB and attracts it closer to the disk. This VBB shift deteriorates the ﬂow convergence to the axis and concentrates the meridional circulation near the sidewall. The pressure grows above the still disk, the suction weakens, which kills the VBB, and the ﬂuid stagnates near the axis. This mechanism is even more pronounced in a two-ﬂuid ﬂow.},

	abstract = {Both the net linear momentum and the net angular momentum of a developing swirling flow can play important parts in determining its ultimate form. To illustrate this the turbulent wake with both axial and swirl components of mean velocity is discussed, in particular for the two limiting cases of domination by linear momentum and domination by angular momentum. The dual conservation of axial and angular momentum implies that in general the mean swirl component decreases more rapidly downstream than does the defect in the mean axial velocity. Hence wakes with non-zero momentum flux ultimately have the familiar length scale

              and velocity defect scale
              \${\textbackslash}sim Z{\textasciicircum}\{\vphantom{\}}-{\textbackslash}frac\{2\}\{3\}\$
              . But in the wake of a self-propelled body the net drag is negligible and a swirl-dominated development can persist with length scale

	abstract = {Multiphase ﬂows occurring in nature and in technological applications are often turbulent. The large range of length scales and timescales in turbulent multiphase ﬂows makes direct numerical simulation of the microscale governing equations intractable for many applications. In this article we review a systematic approach for developing large-eddy-simulation (LES) tools for dispersed multiphase ﬂows starting from the microscale model. A key intermediate step is the mesoscopic model for the dispersed phase, formulated in terms of kinetic equations, that contains the physical models for the ﬂow. Owing to the phase-space variables, direct solution of the mesoscopic model is usually intractable, and additional mathematical approximations are introduced to arrive at a macroscopic model. We show that self-conditioned LES models can be derived for both the mesoscopic and macroscopic models, but the former is preferred to ensure consistency and physical accuracy. The principal difﬁculties and open challenges in closing the LES model equations are highlighted.},

It is now feasible to simulate complex engineering ﬂows using LES. However, apart from the computing power, signiﬁcant challenges still remain for LES to reach a level of maturity that brings this approach to the mainstream of engineering and industrial computations. This paper will describe brieﬂy LES formalism ﬁrst, present a quick glance at its history, review its current state focusing mainly on its applications in transitional ﬂows and gas turbine combustor ﬂows, discuss some major modelling and numerical challenges/issues that we are facing now and in the near future, and ﬁnish with the concluding remarks. ª 2015 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA \& BUAA.},
